# 30-days-of-Kaggle
Nothing special, this repository contains the solution to the exercises of an event hosted by Kagglce [30 Days of ML]. <hr>
Each day, we are assigned a new topic. There are two notebooks for each day. In one of them, we have all the explanantion and examples related to that topic and in the other one we have all the exercises related to it.<hr>
